# AllTube example project
Example project to show how to use AllTube as a library

## Setup

You need to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

This repository does not contain a way to install youtube-dl.

The example code expects youtube-dl to be available at `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/youtube_dl/__main__.py` and Python at `/usr/bin/python`.
If it's not the case, you can adjust these paths in the example files.
